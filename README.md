# Web Scraping Box Office Numbers - Python

This project focuses on web scraping box office numbers using Python. The goal is to retrieve box office data from a website and perform various analysis tasks on the collected data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-box-office.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd web-scraping-box-office
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

The project consists of several Python scripts, each serving a specific purpose. Here's an overview of the available scripts and their functionalities:

- `box_office_scraper.py`: Scrapes box office data from a website and saves it as a CSV file.
- `data_analysis.py`: Performs analysis on the collected box office data, including visualization and summary statistics.

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the `box_office_scraper.py` script to scrape box office data:
   ```
   python box_office_scraper.py
   ```

   This will retrieve the box office data from the website and save it as a CSV file (`box_office_data.csv`).

2. Execute the `data_analysis.py` script to analyze the collected data:
   ```
   python data_analysis.py
   ```

   This script will load the box office data from the CSV file and perform analysis tasks such as plotting charts and displaying summary statistics.

Feel free to modify and customize the scripts according to your specific requirements.
